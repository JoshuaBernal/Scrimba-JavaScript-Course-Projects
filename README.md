## Scrimba JavaScript Course Projects
------------------
This repository contains the projects I finished thanks to the <a href="https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v">JavaScript Course</a> in <a href="https://scrimba.com">Scrimba</a>.

All of these projects are deployed using Netlify. The source code and live website links are provided below.
